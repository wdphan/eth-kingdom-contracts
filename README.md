# ETH-Kingdom Contracts

> Split funds between any address.

This was a simple Dapp implementation that enabled you to pay more than the previous address before you. The highest paying address gets their address ETH Domain listed on the top of the leaderboard. Users can easily deposit or withdraw funds if they have been taken over. The king or queen will have their funds locked until then.
